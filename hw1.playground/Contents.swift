import UIKit


//: ## Q1: Optionals
class Words {
    var wordA : String!
    var wordB : String!
    
    init (wordA: String?, wordB: String?) {
        self.wordA = wordA
        self.wordB = wordB
    }

//: ### Are the values passed in to the **init** function and those set to the instance
//: ### variables the same type? If not, why?


//: No, because wordA and wordB that are passed into the initialization function are Optionals. They may contain either a String, or nil.
//: However, the instance variables are of type String, since they are unwrapped.


//: ## Q2: Variable Types and Function Types
class func arePalindromes(_ words: [String]) -> Bool {
        // let reversedWords = words.map({String($0.characters.reversed())})
        let numElements = words.count
        
        for i in 0 ..< numElements {
            if words[i] != String(words[i].characters.reversed()) {
                return false
            }
        }
    return true
    }
//: ### Why does the compiler dislike the **for loop**? Fix it.
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: The second line was changing the original array, so each element was being compared with itself. Instead, I compared each element with its reversal, and checked if any of the elements was not equal to its reverse. The function also did not return true after checking each element. Also, the function must be declared a class function, since no instances were made.


//: ## Q3: More Functions and Object Initialization
    func isAnagram() -> Bool {
        var countLetters : [Character : Int] = [:] //Line X
        let lenA = self.wordA.characters.count
        let lenB = self.wordB.characters.count
        
        if lenA != lenB {
            return false
        }
        
        var arrA = Array(self.wordA.characters)
        var arrB = Array(self.wordB.characters)
        
        for i in 0...lenA-1 {
            let letter = arrA[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] { //Line Y
                countLetters[letter] = val + 1
            } else {
                countLetters[letter] = 1
            }
        }
        
        for i in 0...lenB-1 {
            let letter = arrB[i]
            if let val = countLetters[letter] {
                countLetters[letter] = val - 1
            } else {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        for (letter, count) in countLetters {
            if count != 0 {
                return false
            }
        }
        
        return true
    }
//: ### What is the problem with declaring **countLetters** as we do in **Line X**,
//: ### and then using it in **Line Y**? Fix it (by only changing **Line X**).
//: ### What else is wrong with this function? You may have to refer to (but **not**
//: ### change) the code at the very bottom. Debug the function.


//: This function is an instance function, not a class function. countLetters was declared, but never initialized. The final return statement should return true.
